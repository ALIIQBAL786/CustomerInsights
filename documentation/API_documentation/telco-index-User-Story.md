**User Story: Credit scoring service for riders**
<br>

| **Item** | **Details** |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ***Summary*** | As a service provider, I want to evaluate the creditworthiness of riders working for food delivery, errands, and other similar applications. I use the Customer Insights API to generate a score for these riders, which can be used by companies and banks to offer credit services to the riders for purchasing a motorcycle, bicycle, or electric scooter. The application can leverage the Customer Insights API to complement the score generated with additional telco data, enhancing the overall credit score. |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** Customer:User<br> **Actors:** Service Provider, Bank System, Rider, Application Service Provider (ASP), Communication Service Provider (CSP)<br> **Scope:** Retrieve relevant behavioral data about the riders from both the delivery apps and the CSP, enabling a comprehensive credit score calculation to support credit decisions for vehicle purchases. |

The CSP sends a final enhanced credit score to the service provider.</li><li>The service provider evaluates the received scores to assess the rider's creditworthiness for purchasing a vehicle.</li></ol><br> **Ends when:** The service provider either approves or declines the credit application based on the insights provided. |
| ***Post-conditions*** | The service provider has sufficient data to approve or deny the credit request for a rider based on a comprehensive score derived from both delivery app activity and telco data. |
| ***Exceptions*** | Several exceptions might occur during the Customer Insights API operations:<br>- Unauthorized: Invalid credentials provided by the service provider.<br>- Consent missing: The rider has not provided consent for sharing delivery or telco data (i.e. permission denied).<br>- Data not found: Insufficient data available from delivery apps or telco records for the rider.<br>- Corporate customers: The API is not applicable for corporate customers. |
